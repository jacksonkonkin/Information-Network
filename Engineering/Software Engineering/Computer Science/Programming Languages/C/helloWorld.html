    <h1>What is C?</h1>
    <p>
        The C PL is whats known as a general purpose language. An important aspect of the C programming language
        is understanding how computer memory works. C is very common and is used in many applications. C is also a 
        compiled language - meaning that in order to run our programs, a compiler must take the code and process it
        and then create an executable file that can be executed.
    </p>
    <h1>How to run a C program</h1>
    <p>
        Every C program uses libraries. These libraries give our program the ability to execute functions such as printf.
        To include a library, at the top of the program add a #include followed by the library in angular brackets.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second important piece of C code is the main function. The main function is the piece of code that is always ran 
        in a program. The main funtion must also return a value, such as an integer.

    <code>
        #include &ltstdio.h><br>
        int main(){<br>
        ...code <br>
            return 0;<br>
        }
    </code>
