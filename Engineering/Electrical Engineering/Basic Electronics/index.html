                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            Let's begin on the atomic level and then slowly work are way up while trying to understand
                            the important physical properties that allow us to create amazing new technologies. What is a thing?
                            A thing, in the most scientific view, is matter. If it occupies space and has weight, then it is matter
                            which makes it a thing. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> 
                            Next question, what is matter made of? That is what we call the elements. The basic building blocks of nature,
                            Elements can't be reduced to a simpler substance by chemical means, and there are amazingly only 100 known
                            elements that make up the etire universe.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> 
                            So now let's quickley break down what makes an element a specific element and get to the first important
                            piece of electricity. So there's these things called atoms. Atoms contain a nucleus that is located in the center
                            of the atom. Inside every nuclues there are protons and neutrons, and the protons have something that is known as 
                            a positive charge while the nuetrons have no charge. It is this charge that holds the universe together. But most 
                            atoms have one more part which is what is most important and fundamental to know, the electron. A negatively charged
                            particle the orbits the proton and nuetron filled nucleus like a moon around a planet.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            So now we have established what a element is and what an atom is, now what? Well we want to know what makes elements
                            different from one another? Well an element is just a large number of atoms which all are identical, so to make a 
                            different element, get atoms that look different, and weigh different. This can be accomplished by finding atoms
                            with a different number of protons in the nucleus and a different weight (remeber that to be matter, the thing must
                            have a weight and take up space, even if it is really small). So we can classify elements by the composition of their 
                            atoms that make them up, namely atomic number and atomic weight.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in
                            the nucleus of the atom. The atomic weight is the combined
                            mass of the protons and nuetrons (nucleus). Electrons are 
                            not included in the mass as their weight is negligible
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Thus far, we know how elements are composed of and we know
                            elements make up everything. We now have a really solid base 
                            to begin talking about the properties of electrons. Going 
                            forward, the only thing we really care about as far as 
                            electronics go are electrons.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom on a model that we call
                            shells. Atoms have a different number of shells depending on
                            how many electrons it has. As far as we are concerned, the
                            only shell that matters is the one that orbits the furthest
                            away from the nucleus known as the valence shell.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Elements that are made up of atoms that have few (three of less) electrons in their valence shell are also good
                            conductors. What this mean is that they have the potential to 
                            get rid of their electrons and give them to another atom
                            (allow flow of electricity).
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Elements that have many electons in their valence shell (five or more) are likely to absorb electrons to fill the
                            remaining spots in their valence shell. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This brings us to the third type of element, the element that 
                            has four electrons in it's valence shell. The most magical
                            and important type of element in all of the technology
                            created in this world so far. The semiconductor. A wonderful 
                            property that allows materials to be both conductors and 
                            insulators under certain conditions. What us clever humans 
                            have done is learn to control the conditions which make the 
                            semiconductors switch properties. This basically creates a 
                            switch we can control with current (don't worry we haven't
                            gotten there yet) that is mere nano-meters in size. We will
                            be going way more in depth into this later so don't worry.

                            Let's quickley begin defining some terms which are vital
                            when trying to understand computers. Starting with ioization -
